In this enhanced simulation:

Mining equipment failures occur randomly with a defined probability. When a failure occurs, mining stops temporarily for repair.
Transportation delays are simulated with a random delay based on a normal distribution with a mean and standard deviation. Resources are transported from each location to the destination after the delay.
Resource availability is tracked and updated throughout the simulation.
The simulation output includes information about mining activities, equipment failures, and resource transportation.
